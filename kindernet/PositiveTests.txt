I feel the love of those who are not around me. I feel really happy when spending time alone. I love and approve of myself. I trust myself. I believe that I can do this. It is a very good day outside. I am safe and sound. All problems have a solution. I compare myself only to my highest self. I see myself as a gift to my people and community. The past has no power over me anymore. I do not give up easily. You are an awesome person.
