It's hard for me to trust others easily. You are not good at this. You are a very rude person. You don't behave nicely with other people. The hotel staff were really unfriendly and mean to customers. I am having a really bad day. These children misbehave with elders. I hate that you think you are better than everyone else. I hate you. I do not like you. That professor sucks at teaching
